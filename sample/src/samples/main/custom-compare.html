            Selected nodes are found by their ids.<br />
            To use this, any lazy loaded nodes to be found must provide their parent nodes in a way the custom comparer can find them.<br />
            In this case, nodes should provide their parents' ids'.<br />
            See JS code for details.

        Oregon and its sub nodes should be selected.<br /> New York, New York City and its sub nodes should be selected.<br/>
        New York and New York City (New York's first child) are lazy loaded.
