            Aurelia is a next generation UI framework. Whether you're building apps for the browser, mobile or desktop, Aurelia can enable
            you to not only create amazing UI, but do it in a way that is maintainable, testable and extensible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aurelia is just JavaScript. However, it's not yesterday's JavaScript, but the JavaScript of tomorrow. By using modern tooling
            we've been able to write Aurelia from the ground up in ECMAScript 2016. This means we have native modules, classes,
            decorators and more at our disposal...and you have them too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only is Aurelia written in modern and future JavaScript, but it also takes a modern approach to architecture. In the
            past, frameworks have been monolithic beasts. Not Aurelia though. It's built as a series of collaborating libraries.
            Taken together, they form a powerful and robust framework for building Single Page Apps (SPAs). However, Aurelia's
            libraries can often be used individually, in traditional web sites or even on the server-side through technologies
            like NodeJS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aurelia is open source, but unlike much open source in the JavaScript space, Aurelia is an official product with commercial
            backing. If your business is going to spend significant money building software, you want to do it on a platform
            that's committed to you as a customer. You want to be able to form a relationship with your technology provider
            to ensure that you and your developers have a solid platform upon which to build your business now and in the
            years to come.
