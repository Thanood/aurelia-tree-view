# aurelia-tree-view

An experimental tree-view custom element for Aurelia.
*At the moment* it depends on [Google Material Icons](https://design.google.com/icons/).
This dependency will be removed later.

Also a means to try [`skeleton-catalog`](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/skeleton-catalog) in practice.

Inspired heavily by: https://github.com/thelgevold/aurelia-treeview

For anyone trying to get it running:

* `npm install && jspm install` in root
* `jspm install` in sample directory
* `gulp watch` in root or sample directory
